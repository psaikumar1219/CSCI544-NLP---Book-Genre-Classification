Implemented an NLP project for book genre classification, leveraging BERT. Employed an LSTM-based summarization
approach guided by Facebook BART ground truths. Evaluated genre prediction accuracy using both original and
LSTM-produced summaries, yielding impressive rates of 58% and 27% respectively. Evaluated summarization quality
using cosine similarity against the Google Pegasus model.
